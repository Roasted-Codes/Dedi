# Differences between `index.js` and `old_index.js`

## 1. **Region Selection and Server Creation Flow**
- **index.js** introduces a new, interactive server creation flow for the `/create` command:
  - Users are prompted to choose between a "Quick Create (Dallas, US)" button or a "Choose by Continent" button.
  - If "Choose by Continent" is selected, users are shown a dropdown of continents, then a dropdown of regions within that continent, before the server is created in the selected region.
  - This is implemented using Discord buttons and select menus, with new event handlers for `interactionCreate` for both button and select menu interactions.
- **old_index.js** only allows server creation from a snapshot, with no region selection or continent/region UI. The server is created in a default or environment-specified region.

## 2. **New Utility Functions**
- **index.js** adds:
  - `getRegions()` to fetch available regions from Vultr.
  - `getContinents()` to group regions by continent for the continent selection UI.
- These are not present in **old_index.js**.

## 3. **Command and Event Handler Refactoring**
- **index.js** consolidates and extends event handlers for Discord interactions:
  - Adds handlers for button interactions (for the new create flow).
  - Adds handlers for continent and region select menus.
  - Keeps all previous select menu handlers (e.g., for status, start, stop, destroy, protect, snapshot).
- **old_index.js** does not have button handlers or continent/region select menu logic.

## 4. **createInstanceFromSnapshot Signature**
- **index.js**: `createInstanceFromSnapshot(snapshotId, label, region = null)` (region can be specified).
- **old_index.js**: `createInstanceFromSnapshot(snapshotId, label)` (region is not parameterized; always uses default or env).

## 5. **CONTINENT_MAP**
- **index.js** introduces a `CONTINENT_MAP` and dynamic region/continent logic for UI.
- **old_index.js** does not have this.

## 6. **General Structure and Comments**
- Both files share most of the same logic for instance management, permissions, and command registration.
- The main difference is the enhanced, interactive server creation experience in **index.js**.

## 7. **No Major Removals**
- No significant features have been removed from **old_index.js** to **index.js**; all previous commands and logic are preserved.

---

**Summary:**
- The main advancement in `index.js` is the interactive, multi-step region selection for server creation, using Discord buttons and select menus, and the supporting backend logic for regions/continents. All other core bot features remain the same as in `old_index.js`.
