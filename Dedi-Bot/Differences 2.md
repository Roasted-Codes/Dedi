Differences 2

- **General Structure & Comments**
  - `index_new.js` is a refactored, cleaner, and more modular version of `index.js`. It has improved comments, clearer sectioning, and more concise code.
  - `index_new.js` includes a last updated timestamp at the top.

- **Configuration & Setup**
  - Both files load environment variables and initialize Discord and Vultr clients similarly.
  - `index_new.js` omits some unused imports and focuses on essentials.

- **Instance State Management**
  - Both use an in-memory `instanceState` object, but `index_new.js` is simpler and omits protection logic (no protectedInstances, protect/unprotect methods).
  - `index.js` includes admin-only protection for instances, which is not present in `index_new.js`.

- **Vultr API Functions**
  - Both provide wrappers for Vultr API actions (list, get, start, stop, create, delete, billing, snapshots).
  - `index_new.js` adds a grouped region fetcher (`getGroupedRegions`) for continent/country/city selection.
  - `index.js` includes more detailed logging and error handling for API requests.

- **Firewall Handling**
  - `index_new.js` optionally attaches a firewall group to new instances if enabled via environment variables.
  - This logic is not present in `index.js`.

- **Command Definitions**
  - Both define Discord slash commands for listing, status, start, stop, create, and destroy.
  - `index.js` includes additional admin commands: `/protect` and `/snapshot`, which are not present in `index_new.js`.
  - `index_new.js` adds autocomplete for city selection in the `/create` command and supports continent/city selection for server deployment.
  - `index.js` uses buttons for "Quick Create" and "Choose by Continent" in the `/create` command, while `index_new.js` uses a city autocomplete option.

- **Interaction Handlers**
  - Both handle select menus for server actions (status, start, stop, destroy).
  - `index.js` has more complex interaction handling for admin features (protect, snapshot).
  - `index_new.js` includes handlers for continent and city selection, and for autocomplete.

- **Permissions**
  - `index.js` has a more advanced permission system, including admin checks and instance protection.
  - `index_new.js` does not implement instance protection or admin-only commands.

- **Utility Functions**
  - Both have similar formatting functions for displaying instance status/details.
  - `index_new.js` includes a function to format a list of instances.

- **Event Handlers**
  - Both register commands on bot ready and handle command execution with error handling.
  - `index_new.js` is more modular and concise in its event handling.

- **Other Notable Differences**
  - `index.js` is more feature-rich (admin commands, protection, snapshotting, more detailed logging).
  - `index_new.js` is more streamlined, with a focus on core server management and improved region/city selection UX.

**Summary:**  
`index_new.js` is a refactored, simplified, and more maintainable version of `index.js`, focusing on core server management features and improved user experience for region/city selection. `index.js` contains more advanced features (admin commands, instance protection, snapshotting) and more verbose logging, but is less modular and more complex.
