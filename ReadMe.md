# Halo 2 Dedicated Server Enhancement Project

This project aims to simplify and optimize dedicated servers ("dedis") for Halo 2 on the original Xbox, making them more accessible to the community.

## Goals

1. Develop a Discord bot that can automatically deploy dedicated servers on VPS platforms like Vultr
2. Optimize Xemu for lower resource consumption when running as a Halo 2 server
3. Implement container solutions (Games On Whales, Sunshine/Moonlight) for simplified session management

**Shoutout to Kantanomo, Xbox7887, Mborgerson, and MVC for their contributions to the community and making this possible**
